# About this Repository
This repository contains various resources in connection to an introduction to monitoring.

Monitoring is a general term and can cover a lot of things but in this case the focus is on monitoring containerbased applications using:
* Prometheus
* Grafana

These technologies are often used in Kubernetes based architectures. In the repository everything runs on your machine. All you need is a Docker and Docker compose.

First go through [The monitoring setup](01-monitoring-setup) in order to get Prometheus and Grafana up and running.

Now we are ready to start monitoring some applications. Go through [The application setup](02-application-setup) in order to get the test applications running.
